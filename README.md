Palma. Your companion to being a better you. A hackathon project.

## Why PALMA?
Most health apps rely on aggressive metrics, constant reminders, and device-heavy tracking.
This leads to:
- false reporting
- anxiety around food
- user not achieving their goal
- users abandoning the app entirely

_Palma explores a different approach - reflection over enforcement._

## What is PALMA?
PALMA is a web-based wellness application that helps users achieve their dietary goals, reflect on their daily food and habits
using indirect, _healthy,_ non-judgmental prompts.

Instead of punishing calories or constant alerts, PALMA:
- frames food positively.
- nudges gently.
- uses reason instead of just metrics.
- builds honesty & trust over time.

We utilise Foot-in-the-Door technique and consistency bias: The idea being if the user commits to a "truthful persona" through easy, indirect questions, they are more likely to maintain that integrity when things get personal (like what they ate). Thus helping reduce false reporting.


## Core Features
- Calm onboarding with diet preferences and goals.
- Daily reflection flow using _healthy_ questions.
- Designed with emotional UX in mind. (focused on reflection, not judgment)
- A daily Health Score based on consistency, value and balance, not perfection.
- Food logging with positive framing (no red warnings).
- Context-aware AI companion (non-medical use).
- Human-first and privary-first design.
